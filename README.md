first project on github YIPPEE

Solves for x on one or both sides of an equation.

Takes in a user input, then parses it into a form that Python can evaluate
Uses newton's method and root division to remove zeros after found, up to 10 potential roots

Then it reevaluates the found roots against the original function and removes roots caused by floating point division resulting in insanity

Allows support for both `math` and `cmath` functions, with math being the main namespace.
